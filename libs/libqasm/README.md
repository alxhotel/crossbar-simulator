1. git submodule update --init --recursive
2. mkdir **cbuild**
3. cd **cbuild**
4. cmake **../library**
5. make or make -j \<Number of processors\>
6. make test or make test -j \<Number of processors\>

### As a python3 module
1. git submodule update --init --recursive
2. python3 setup.py --install --user

### Cleaning up the **qasm\_flex\_bison** directory
In order to clean up the entire source directory when a user installs using the setup.py python script:
1. make clean
