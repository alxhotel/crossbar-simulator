  grammar tools, a set of tools for manipulating BNF grammars.

The tools
  gcopy 	-- copy (and pretty print) a grammar, stdin to stdout
  gdeebnf	-- remove Wirth-style EBNF extensions
  gdeempty	-- rewrite grammar to remove empty symbol, if possible
  gsqueeze	-- like gramcopy but also eliminate redundant rules and symbols
  gsample	-- output one random string from the grammar, stdin to stdout
  gstartfollow 	-- output the start set and follow set of all symbols
  gstats	-- gather basic statistics on grammar, stdin to stdout

  Makefile	-- make one or more of the above, or make with no args for help

Source files for main programs that weave together components
  gcopy.c	-- gcopy
  gdeebnf.c	-- gdeebnf
  gdeempty.c	-- gdeempty
  gsqueeze.c	-- gsqueeze
  gsample.c	-- gsample
  gstartfollow 	-- gstartfollow
  gstats.c	-- gstats

Source files for components
  grammar.h	-- framework

  readgram.c	-- read grammar from stdin
  readgram.h
  reachable.c	-- mark reachable symbols in the grammar
  reachable.h
  writetool.c	-- tools for formatting output to stdout
  writetool.h
  writegram.c	-- pretty print grammar to stdout
  writegram.h
  gramstats.c	-- statistics gathering mechanism
  gramstats.h
  squeezegram.c	-- eliminate redundant production rules and nonterminals
  squeezegram.h
  samplegram.c	-- generate a random string from the grammar
  samplegram.h
  deempty.c	-- rewrite grammar to remove empty symbol, if possible
  deempty.h
  deebnf.c	-- remove Wirth-style EBNF extensions
  deebnf.h

Some example grammars
  gram.gr	-- the EBNF grammar of the BNF and EBNF notation used here
  errors.gr	-- generate as many error messages as possible
  bnf.gr	-- simple BNF for expressions
  ebnf.gr	-- extended BNF for expressions

Warranty
  The gtools code is basically junk, so it is offered here as freeware.
  You get what you pay for, and if it does anything you consider
  useful, that is good, but if it breaks, you bear the entire burden  
  of responsibility for using such junk.

License
  The gtools code is basically junk, so there's no point to dolling it
  up with fancy license agreements.  Basically, it's free; if you can
  make something useful from it, you are welcome to assert any rights
  you wish to your improvements, so long as you credit me (Douglas W.
  Jones at the University of Iowa) for the foundation on which you
  built.  Feel free to redistribute this code to anyone, as is or with
  your additions and improvements.
